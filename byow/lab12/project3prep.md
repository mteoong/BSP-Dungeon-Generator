**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

Did not attend lab. 

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
Each room and hallway is analogous to a hexagon in that it's an individual unit. A world putting together combinations of rooms and
hallways is analogous to our tesselation, which combined several hexagons.
Another way to interpret it is that a hallway is analogous to a hallway because it is a single unit. As rooms can be constructed with
combinations of hallways, a room is analogous to a tesselation.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: A method to make hallways, given coordinates. 

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is linear while a room is rectangular. A room is made up of hallways.
